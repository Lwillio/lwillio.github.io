I started in IT with little more experience than "that one time I installed Ubuntu" and tinkering on an old Jeep. Granted, that Ubuntu install was on a Mac partition with a boot menu, but I spent an afternoon figuring out how to make the keyboard lights work properly. On my second day on the job, I found Powershell - which I immediately figured out how to use to change my coworker's desktop background to He-Man (while he was working from home).

From there I was writing an AppleScript from scratch to automate and standardize laptop builds; various PowerShell scripts to update Active Directory, create folder structures, install software remotely, or perform software audits; or BaSH scripting a folder dating logic that would be one line in Powershell because .ps1 files are blocked by antivirus - I fell in love with scripting. 

_And then I found SQL_. I had stored procedures to create new users, update and merge duplicate data entries - anything I ran into frequently I would standardize as much as possible and script out. I once used a very inelegant mix of a PIVOT and CAST (field) as 'X' to create a visualization of user privileges by role in SSMS. 

After honing my skills in a series of SQL workshops, I moved on to Data Analytics. This gave me more chances to play with SQL and introduced me to R scripting (scripting!!), regular expressions, and Tableau. Turns out, data cleaning was the most fulfilling aspect of the course for me.

So, now, I am looking toward the next step in my journey - Data Engineering - a way to combine my loves of scripting and data cleaning with a focus on efficiency and automation. I would love to connect with you on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lwilliamson) to discuss any Data Steward, Specialist or Engineer roles you may have available, and how my skills could benefit you. Please reach out!
