I started in IT with little more experience than "that one time I installed Ubuntu" and tinkering on an old Jeep. On my second day on the job, I discovered Powershell and used it to change my coworker's desktop background to He-Man (while he was working from home). For learning purposes.

From there I was writing an AppleScript from scratch to automate and standardize laptop builds; various PowerShell scripts to update Active Directory, create folder structures, install software remotely, or perform software audits; or BaSH scripting a [folder dating logic](script link) that would be one line in Powershell because .ps1 files are blocked by antivirus - I fell in love with scripting. 

_And then I found SQL_. I had stored procedures to create new users, update and merge duplicate rows - anything I ran into frequently I would standardize and [script](link to example PIVOT/CAST inelegancy). Data Analytics was the next logical step. I got to play with SQL and found R scripting (scripting!!), regular expressions, and Tableau. Turns out, data cleaning was the most fulfilling aspect of the course for me.

I am currently in a position where I use AWS S3, Athena and SSMS frequently, as well as Apache Pig scripts for ETL. 

I am looking toward the final step in my journey - Data Engineering - a way to combine my loves of scripting and data cleaning with a focus on efficiency and increasing automation. I would love to connect with you on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lwilliamson) to discuss any Data Stewardship, Specialist or Engineer roles you may have available, and how my skills and experience could benefit you. Please reach out!
